#  Movie Recommendation System – Internship Project

This project was completed as part of my internship at Edureka. It focuses on building a recommendation engine using open-source MovieLens data to support a fictional OTT startup “MyNextMovie.”

## Objectives

- Build 3 recommendation models:
  -  Popularity-based filtering
  -  Content-based filtering (based on genre similarity)
  -  Collaborative filtering (based on user behavior)

---

## Dataset

- Source: [MovieLens 100K dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- Contains:
  - 105,339 ratings from 668 users across 10,329 movies
  - `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` files

---

## Techniques Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Cosine similarity
- K-Nearest Neighbors for collaborative filtering
- EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Optional UI with ipywidgets (for Jupyter)
